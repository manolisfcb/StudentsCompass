# 🧭 Student Compass  
**Your Career. Your Direction.**

Student Compass is a career navigation platform designed to help students gain clarity, confidence, and direction in their professional journey — especially within the Canadian job market.

## 🚀 The Student Compass Journey

The journey is structured into **7 guided steps**, each designed to build on the previous one. There are **no right or wrong answers** — the goal is clarity, not evaluation.

---

## 🟢 STEP 1 — Discover Yourself (My Compass)

**Purpose:**  
Understand who you are, what you value, and how your preferences align with real opportunities.

Students explore:
- Personal preferences
- Work styles
- Soft skills
- Motivations and strengths

> There are no correct or incorrect answers.  
> Your soft skills are a powerful asset in connecting with opportunities that bring real satisfaction.

## 🟢 STEP 2 — Resume & CV Alignment (Toolkit: Resume)

**Purpose:**  
Align your job search with your profile — avoid applying everywhere without strategy.

Key concepts:
- Canadian resume format
- Resume ≠ job description
- Alignment between your profile and target roles

### Additional
- 📄 **Cover Letter fundamentals**
- How to tailor it without rewriting from scratch every time

---

## 🟢 STEP 3 — LinkedIn Optimization (Toolkit: LinkedIn)

**Purpose:**  
Turn your LinkedIn profile into a discovery tool — not just a static resume.

Your profile should:
- Clearly reflect the roles you are targeting
- Highlight relevant experience
- Project confidence through a professional photo

LinkedIn is not only for applying — it helps you access opportunities **before they are published**.

> Many roles are filled before reaching job boards due to early saturation.

### Strategy Highlight
- Publish regularly
- Use relevant hashtags aligned with your target roles
- Position yourself where recruiters are already looking

## 🟢 STEP 4 — Building Your Network (Community)

**Purpose:**  
Shift from *searching* to *being discovered*.

LinkedIn enables you to:
- Build real professional relationships
- Position yourself as a voice in your area of interest
- Attract recruiters, head-hunters, and hiring leaders

### Best Practices
- Connect intentionally with people relevant to your target roles
- Focus on **real relationships**, not transactional interactions
- Engage with content meaningfully

## 🟢 STEP 5 — Interview Preparation (AI Coach)

**Purpose:**  
Prepare with confidence and clarity.

Before interviews:
- Research the company (values, products, services)
- Understand what makes them different
- Review the interviewer’s LinkedIn profile

The most important skill:
- Answering questions **clearly, concisely, and professionally**
- Demonstrating results using the **STAR method**

### Interview Guidance
- Practice common questions
- Use real examples from your resume
- Maintain a confident and professional tone
- Never speak negatively about previous employers

💡 Always prepare thoughtful questions that show genuine interest in the role and company.

## 🟢 STEP 6 — Job Hunting (Curated Sources)

**Purpose:**  
Apply strategically — not randomly.

Student Compass shares curated job sources such as:
- HiringCafe
- Indeed
- Remote job platforms

> This step focuses on **where and how to search**, not on hosting job listings.

⚠️ In the MVP, Student Compass does **not** aggregate or scrape job boards automatically.

---

## 🟢 STEP 7 — Become a LinkedIn Thought Leader

**Purpose:**  
Access the **hidden job market** — up to 70% of roles are never publicly posted.

By:
- Sharing insights
- Publishing relevant content
- Consistently engaging in your field

Recruiters begin reaching out **to you**.
